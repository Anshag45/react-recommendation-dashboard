# E-commerce Product Recommender

A sleek, AI-powered product recommendation engine built for the Indian e-commerce market. Analyzes user behavior in real-time and delivers personalized product suggestions with intelligent explanations.

## What It Does

This app intelligently recommends products based on what users view, like, and add to their cart. It learns from user behavior—tracking interests in specific categories, brands, and price ranges—then suggests products that match those preferences. Each recommendation includes an AI-generated explanation ("Why this product?") that tells users exactly why it's relevant to them.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Smart Recommendations**: Content-based algorithm that analyzes user behavior (views, likes, cart additions) to suggest relevant products
- **AI Explanations**: LLM-powered insights that explain why each product is recommended
- **Real-Time Learning**: Tracks interactions and updates recommendations dynamically
- **Indian Market Focus**: Curated products from popular Indian brands (boAt, Mi, Noise, Campus, Puma, Realme, Fastrack) with INR pricing
- **Beautiful Dashboard**: Dark-themed UI with confidence scores, price insights, dynamic tags, and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop (3-column grid) and mobile (1-column)

## How It Works

1. **User Behavior Tracking**: The app records every interaction—views, likes, cart additions, purchases
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Derives user preferences (favorite categories, brands, average price point)
3. **Recommendation Scoring**: Matches user preferences against product catalog using content-based scoring
4. **AI Explanations**: Generates human-readable explanations for why each product is recommended
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays recommendations with confidence scores, price insights, and one-click actions

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Database**: Neon Postgres
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-5-mini
- **UI**: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Dark mode by default with light/dark toggle

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Database

Add your Neon Postgres connection string to **Vars** in the v0 sidebar:
- Key: `DATABASE_URL`
- Value: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require` (use non-pooled host)

### 2. Seed Data

Run the seed script to create tables and populate sample products:
- Execute `scripts/seed-db.ts` from the Code Project

### 3. Visit Dashboard

Open `/recommender` and click **"Use demo user"** to test with pre-seeded data.
